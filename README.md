all_GII4_VP1.fasta - contains 2198 VP1 (capsid) sequences from all GII.4 variants. Used to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree containing all GII.4 variants and reconstruct VP1 substitutions across the tree

all_GII_nonstructural.fasta - contains 1183 nonstructural polyproteins sequences from the GII and GIV genogroups. Used to reconstruct nonstructural polyprotein substitutions across the tree

all_GII.4_VP2.fasta - contains 1127 VP2 sequences from all GII.4 variants. Used to reconstruct VP2 substitutions across the tree

VP1_sample1.fasta - contains 241 VP1 sequences from all GII.4 variants used to reconstruct the temporal history of the GII.4 VP1. VP1_sample2.fasta and VP1_sample3.fasta contain different subsets of Den Haag 2006 and New Orleans 2009 sequences

RdRp_sample1.fasta - contains 242 RdRp sequences from the RdRp variants associated with the GII.4 VP1. Used to reconstruct the temporal history of the RdRp. RdRp_sample2.fasta and RdRp_sample3.fasta contain different subsets of Den Haag 2006 and New Orleans 2009 sequences

VP2_sample1.fasta - contains 241 VP2 sequences from all GII.4 variants used to reconstruct the temporal history of the GII.4 VP2. VP2_sample2.fasta and VP2_sample3.fasta contain different subsets of Den Haag 2006 and New Orleans 2009 sequences

new_orleans_2009_VP1.fasta - contains 565 VP1 sequences from the GII.4 New Orleans 2009 variant. Used to reconstruct the phylodynamic history of this variant

sydney_2012_VP1.fasta - contains 708 VP1 sequences from the GII.4 Sydney 2012 variant. Used to reconstruct the phylodynamic history of this variant
